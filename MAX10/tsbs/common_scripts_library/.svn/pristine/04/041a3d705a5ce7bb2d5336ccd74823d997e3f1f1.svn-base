# This script will take the <nios_application>.elf file created by the Nios II
# IDE and process it into a binary image that can be programmed into flash.
# This script adds a header to the applciation image that contains a number of
# useful elements that an intelligent boot loader is intened to interpret before
# it loads the image into execution memory.  The elements that make up the
# attached header are as follows:
#
#   signature = 32-bit word, user assigned, intended to hold a signature used
#               to locate the header in flash memory
#     version = 32-bit word, user assigned, inteneded to hold a binary encoded
#               version identifier for the application
#   timestamp = 32-bit word, script generated, assigns the current time value,
#               the standard C time integer value, seconds since JAN 01, 1970
# data length = 32-bit word, script generated, assigns the byte length of the
#               application data contained in the file
#    data crc = 32-bit word, script generated, assigns the crc32 calculated
#               across the entire application data
#        res1 = 32-bit word, user assigned, use is unspecified
#        res2 = 32-bit word, user assigned, use is unspecified
#  header crc = 32-bit word, script generated, assigns the crc32 calculated
#               across the other 28-bytes of the header data
#
# The current usage for the script is as follows:
#
#   ./make_flash_image_script <application_name.elf>
#     <application_name.elf> = elf file containing the Nios II application
#
              # These indented sections are just going to contain error checking
              # and other script overhead stuff, but don't really have anything
              # to do with the meat of the processing that needs to be done.
              #
              # Before we get started, we'll simply check the input arguments to
              # make sure everything seems in order.
              #
