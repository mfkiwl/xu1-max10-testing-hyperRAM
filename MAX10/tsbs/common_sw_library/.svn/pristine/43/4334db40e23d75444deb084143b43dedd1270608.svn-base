janssonxx is a simple C++ wrapper around the Jansson library.

It does not purport to be as flexible or efficient as what a competent
developer can achieve using the Jansson C API, but it does offer a
safe and easy to use API that should cover most users' needs.

janssonxx is developed by Sean Middleditch <sean@middleditch.us> and
is released under the MIT/X license, same as Jansson:
