# This script is used to extract all of the C macro parameters from our custom
# components.  This is required because some of the components do not get
# connected to the data master of the Nios processor, so they are not reported
# in the system.h header that the BSP generator creates.  This also serves as
# an example of how to do this for masters other than the Nios processor in
# general, as that situation can often arise as well.
