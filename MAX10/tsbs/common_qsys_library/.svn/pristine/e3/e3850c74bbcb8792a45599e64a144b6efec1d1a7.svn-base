This component is used to generate reset for a PLL and monitor the acquisition
of lock for the PLL, and then monitor for PLL lock failures.

This component asserts the pll_reset output asynchronously with the assertion
of the pll_reset_request input.  Then the pll_reset output is asserted for a
minimum of the terminal count of the reset_count counter.  This allows you to
specify the minimum duration of the pll_reset output by setting the
RESET_COUNTER_WIDTH parameter.  Most Altera PLLs require a minimum of 10ns
assertion of their reset, however I would suggest that you allow this reset to
assert for 100ns to 1us just to be certain that other system reset effects are
allowed time to propogate throughout the system.

Once the pll_reset output is released, the pll_locked input is masked for the
duration of the lock_count counter which you can specify with the
LOCK_COUNTER_WIDTH parameter.  Altera typically recommends that you allow 1ms
for PLL lock acquisition, so you should select the value of LOCK_COUNTER_WIDTH
to produce a period near that timeframe.  At the expiration of the lock_count
the state of the pll_locked input is evaluated to produce a lock_success or
lock_failure output, and from that point on if the pll_locked glitches or drops
for any amount of time the lock_failure output should be asserted.  This circuit
allows the PLL lock to stutter into the locked state and then monitor for even a
small asynchronous glitch that indicates the loss of lock.

To achieve this behavior the pll_locked input is passed through the
altera_reset_synchronizer core to asynchronously detect glitches and synchronize
the pll_locked input into the proper clock domain.

There is an Avalon Slave interface on this component that provides access to
read the values of two counts that are captured in this component.  First, each
time the pll_locked input is asserted, the lock_count value is captured into a
register which can be read through the slave.  Second, each time the pll_locked
input is deasserted, a unlock_count counter is incremented and provided thru the
slave interface as well.  The lock_counter_width field contains the value of 19
minus the LOCK_COUNTER_WIDTH parameter.

The format of the 32-bits in the slave register are as follows:
	unlock_count_sync       [31:24] - 8-bit field
	lock_counter_width      [23:20] - 4-bit field
	capture_lock_count_sync [19:0]  - 20-bit field

The SDC file that accompanies this component provides constraints that cut the
asynchronous input paths of the altera_reset_synchronizer instance.

To constrain the outputs of this component in your own SDC constraints, you can
locate the output registers of the component with something like this:
[get_registers {*pll_reset_monitor:*|delayed_pll_reset}]
[get_registers {*pll_reset_monitor:*|lock_success_reg}]
[get_registers {*pll_reset_monitor:*|lock_failure_reg}]
