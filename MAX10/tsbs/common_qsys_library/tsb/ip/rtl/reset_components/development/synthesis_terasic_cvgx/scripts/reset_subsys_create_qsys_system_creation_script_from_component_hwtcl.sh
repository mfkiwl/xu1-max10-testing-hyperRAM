# This script is designed to take the _hw.tcl file exported from Qsys for the
# complete Qsys system and transform it into a Qsys system creation script that
# can be passed into qsys-script to create the system from an original source
# TCL script.  To create the _hw.tcl script, run qsys-edit, open your existing
# Qsys system and choose File->"Export system as hw.tcl component".
#
# Assign proper values for the 5 environment variables below before running
# this script.
#

#
# This should be a relative path from the location of this script to the
# location of the Qsys _hw.tcl file.
