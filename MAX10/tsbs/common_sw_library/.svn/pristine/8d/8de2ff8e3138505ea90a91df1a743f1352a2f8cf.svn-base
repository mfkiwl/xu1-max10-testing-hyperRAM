I have designed this software, because I required it for own use. 
Hence I tried to make it as stable and reliable as possible 
and necessary for the designated applications (which normally 
are for the scientific or industrial market). 

For non-commercial projects and tests, the use of my software 
is free of charge. However, as soon as you make profit with it,
you need to license the use. 

This software may be used under a "Fair Use" license. 
This means: everybody can use it for free under the following conditions:

1.) As long as it is used for non-commercial use or for education.
2.) I give no warranty for this software! Using it is at your own risk!
If you want to use the software in commercial products, please contact me.
